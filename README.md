#Superformula Explorer

This is a visual implementation of the [Superformula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula).

To run, just clone/download the repo and run index.html in Chrome/Firefox.

You can explore the superformula by either modifying individual parameters, or just by hitting the "random" button 
to see the shape created by a random combination of parameters.
